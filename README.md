<h4>AimTrainer</h4>

This was the first successful Python Game program I made.
All credit for code goes to Tech With Tim.

DESCRIPTION:
A simple click game where you click the targets as they appear, and your time, score, and accuracy appears at the end.

<h4>Iris Classification ML Project</h4>
This was a simple machine learning project I did for use with the Iris Petals/Sepals Dataset.

<br/>DESCRIPTION:
A basic neural network for classifying different Iris species/classes

<h4>Weather Dashboard (paused)</h4>
First simple full-stack experimentation. Realized I need a bit more practice/knowledge with/of back-end before continuing.

<br/>DESCRIPTION:
A weather dashboard for getting the weather in a certain location. Simple project with Javascript, python, css, and HTML.

<h4>Macaw Project</h4>
This was my second machine learning project. First in Imagedata.py converted images in three files into a pickle format (image_data.pkl). Then finally wrote the model in imageml.py. Haven't fully optimized it yet, and haven't finished the comment documentation for the process. Extensively used ChatGPT's assistance, but mostly to learn implementation and not theory, thankfully.

<br/>DESCRIPTION:
A Supervised machine learning classification 'algorithm' to identify whether an image is a macaw, a bird, or not a bird. Uses 2 convolutional layers and then flattens the data to be read by two regularized Dense layers.
